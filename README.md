**Project 2 for Math135B Winter 2024**

The Python program solves an initial value problem with four varying values of h, employing 
two numerical methods, namely the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector scheme and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.

The script computes the numerical solution for different step sizes h = 0,5, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and compares them with an exact solution on 4 different plots.

By plotting the numerical and exact solutions in separate figures for each step size, we are able to easily compare the methods and exact solution.
